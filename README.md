# Juketape

## Concept
Juketake is a website which aggregates the media content from a user's social accounts. It will be a portfolio website, targeting media content creators who publish their content on social media. The aggregated data will be rendered visually to an end user to find and discover. The tentative website name would be https://juketake.com 

## Product development stages
Initially, the goal is to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with the basic capabilities to get it up and running. This would include, and not limited to authorization, authentication, OAuts and database setup. 


## Workflow

From an end user perspective, the workflow would be as follows -  

* User comes into the main landing page where he or she is expected to provide credentials to sign in or sign up.  
* The user is prompted to a Settings page where he or she has to fill in some basic profile information and connect his/her social accounts using OAuth. This can only be visible to the user who has signed in, and should not be visible to the public.   
* The profile page of the user would be visible to the public, which visually renders the information of the user's social medial accounts to the public. The url would be https://juketake.com/users/{artistename}

## Expectations
As explicitly mentioned, the front end code is ready for the the pages defined in the Workflow. What is needed is help in packaging this as an app and connecting it with the right database with the required security implementation. I will be working with the developer using GitHub.
